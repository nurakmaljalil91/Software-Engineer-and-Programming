## Overview

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, [open source](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

[[EF Core]] can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), which:

- Enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.
- Eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that typically needs to be written.

[[EF Core]] supports many database engines, see [Database Providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/) for details.
